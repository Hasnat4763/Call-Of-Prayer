# Privacy Policy for Call of Prayer

**Last Updated:** 21/04/2025

Thank you for using Call of Prayer (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension uses and protects your information.

**1. Information We Collect and How We Use It**

The Extension requires access to your device's location to calculate accurate local prayer times. This location data is processed **locally on your device only**.

**We do not collect, transmit, or store your location data on any external servers or platforms.** The Extension uses your location solely to perform the prayer time calculations within your browser or operating system.

**2. Local Storage**

The Extension utilizes your device's local storage for the following purposes:

* **Saving Location Preferences:** To remember your preferred location for consistent prayer time calculations, so you don't have to enter it repeatedly. This data remains on your local machine and is not accessed by us.
* **Storing Notification Preferences:** If you customize your notification settings (e.g., which prayers to be notified for, lead time, sound), these preferences are stored locally on your device.

**3. Notifications**

The Extension may use your device's notification system to remind you of prayer times based on your locally stored location and notification preferences. These notifications are generated locally by the Extension based on the calculations performed on your device. **No personal data is transmitted to enable these notifications.**

**4. Data Sharing**

**We do not share your location data, notification preferences, or any other personal information with any third parties.** Your data stays on your device.

**5. Security**

Because all location processing, data storage, and notification scheduling occur locally on your device, the risks associated with transmitting and storing data externally are eliminated. We have implemented measures within the Extension to ensure the integrity of its functionality.

**6. Children's Privacy**

The Extension does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

**8. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by mailing in abulhasnat5737@gmail.com.
